This program is used to reduce the number of holograms recorded during an experience with a LynceeTec DHM.
 
The program will reduce the frame rate by the given factor RFR (positive integer).
The program will average over a given number of holograms NAV (positive integer).
You can chose RFR and NAV and if the initial hologram files will be overwritten or if the new ones will be saved in a new folder.
The new frame rate equals the initial frame rate divided by RFR.
The program creates a new timestamps file where the timestamps correspond to the new frame rate. A new timestamp "n" corresponds to the intial timestamp n*RFR+int(NAV/2) (n=0,1,2,...).
